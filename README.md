# sp-dashboard
Dashboard for project management backed by Sharepoint functionalities.

To experiment with 2 libraries/API which rely on Jquery namely :
1. Sharepoint Plus
2. SP services

To create a web-dashboard via HTML/CSS which can interact directly which Sharepoint data-structures (Lists, Forms,Contact, etc.).

This is to avoid using generic template provided by Sharepoint when building a Sharepoint site.

This is a sample site.
